# Cross-Database-Examination-of-NGAC

One important aspect of modern-day large-scale organizations is to provide users with controlled data. Researchers over the years have come up with different access control policies for this purpose. These policies limit usersâ€™ capabilities to perform different operations. This is done using access control frameworks. Access control has been an ongoing challenge for decades. And different researchers have come up with solutions considering different aspects of challenges. Sometimes, newer models have been proposed to overcome the limitations of previous models. Other times, more complicated models have been introduced to face new challenges posed by the changes in organizational needs or in the need for different sets of capabilities from an administration perspective. It is of utmost importance to ensure security. But often, it comes at the cost of reduced performance. This paper focuses on a specific access control mechanism called Next Generation Access Control (NGAC). NGAC performs better than other access control mechanisms and offers much more flexibility but its implementation with MySQL has some performance issues when used at a very large scale. PostgreSQL, due to how it implements access control internally, performs faster and also offers more flexibility. This paper provides a comparative view of implementing NGAC with MySQL and with PostgreSQL.
